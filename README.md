This is a Progressive Web Application built for the person on the go. To use, simply enter the name of your transaction, the amount, and select "Add Funds" for deposits or "Subtract Funds" for spendatures. Upon completion, the total will be updated and the transaction will be added to a chart that gives a visual representation of spending and earning over time.
