To test the offline functionality, use Chrome's DevTools. Navigate to the Network tab, and at the very top, select "Offline" from the dropdown. Create a transaction and it will display to the screen. Turn your internet connection back on and you will receive a notification that the balance has been updated. When you refresh the page, your changes will remain.
